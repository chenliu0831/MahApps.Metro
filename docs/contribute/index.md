### How We Deal With Issues

All of our issues are tracked on GitHub. A few things come up on StackOverflow, but we always try and bring the discussion back to GitHub. Why?

  - **SO questions are generally incomplete** - the format does not lend itself to getting to the bottom of anything non-code related.
  - **SO threads are terrible for discussions** - and quite often we need to diagnose the issue before we can provide an answer
  - **it quite often it needs a code change** - and there's no way I can easily indicate that "just download XYZ version which has this fix" because of how threads work

So I prefer GitHub for these sorts of things because of how issues can be associated with pull requests and commits. 

### How Do I Raise An Issue

Yes, you need a GitHub account to sign up. But just about every site out there on the internet requires you to do this so it's not exactly an outrageous request.

### Some Three Letter Acronyms We Use

**[WIP]** - Work In Progress - this is a tag we include on any pull request that is not ready for consumption. We do this because it's always A Good Thing to start a pull request early so that we can get feedback on it early.

**[RFC]** - Request for Comment - this is a tag we use on any pull request to indicate when we're not sure about something. Perhaps it's an idea for something, perhaps it's a hard issue to nail down. The code might be useless, but this is our way to ask "does this make sense?"
